What is Property tax?\\nProperty tax is an asset tax levied on property ownership. It is not a tax on rental income. It is thus levied on the ownership of\\nproperties, irrespective of whether the property is occupied or vacant.\\n2. How is property tax calculated? \\xa0\\nThe property tax is calculated by multiplying the\\xa0 Annual Value (AV) \\xa0of the property with the prevailing\\xa0 property tax rate .\\nAnnual Value (AV)\\nEvery property has an AV. This AV of a property is determined based on market rentals of similar or comparable properties. What this\\nmeans is that if you own a \\x00ve-room \\x00at in Toa Payoh, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) looks at similar \\x00ve-room \\x00ats\\nin Toa Payoh and how much they are rented out at, to determine the Annual Value.\\nProperty Tax rates \\xa0\\nWe have progressive property tax rates for residential properties- the higher the value of the residential property, the higher the tax\\nrate.\\nChanges were introduced in Budget 2022 to both\\xa0 owner-occupied homes , and\\xa0 non-owner occupied residential properties .Property Tax on Residential Property\\nAll you need to know about property tax on residential property\\n6 min read  Published on 24 Nov 2023A Singapore Government Agency W ebsite How to identify\\n'),\n",

That means\\nthat all owner-occupied HDB \\x00ats are not a\\x00ected. The new rates took e\\x00ect on 1 January 2023 and 1 January 2024.\\nNon-Owner-Occupied Residential Properties\\n(This refers to residential buildings which are not owner-occupied and does not include residential land.)\\nAll non-owner-occupied residential properties will face higher property taxes.

Why does my Annual Value change over the years?\\nAs property tax is an asset tax based on property ownership, AV is reviewed and adjusted to re\\x00ect the change in market values of\\ncomparable property. The AV may be revised upwards, downwards or kept at the same level depending on the market values.\\n5. Why do I have to pay property tax on my home when I am an owner-occupier and not deriving rental income? \\xa0\\nProperty tax is based on property ownership and therefore is levied regardless of whether the property is owner-occupied, vacant or\\nrented out.

Property tax is imposed based on property ownership. It is di\\x00erent from income tax on the rental\\nincome, which is a tax on the income which an individual earns.\\nFor more information on property tax, please refer to IRAS'\\xa0 website .\\n7. Why not use Capital Value to estimate Annual Value for property tax calculation? \\xa0\\nIn Singapore,\\xa0we use rental transactions of comparable properties to determine the AV of the property for the purpose of property tax,\\nfor two reasons.\\nFirst, there are generally more rental transactions than sales transactions, to allow AV to be determined for each property based on\\ncomparable properties. Second, movements in sale prices are more volatile than rentals. Hence, using rental transactions to derive the\\nAV helps to keep property tax more stable for property owners.\\nThis practice of using market rents to determine the AV is also adopted by other jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Malaysia.\\n8. How else do we tax wealth?\\xa0\\nWe tax wealth through the property tax, stamp duty, and additional registration fee for motor vehicles. The higher value the residential\\nproperty or motor vehicle, the higher the tax.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe will continue to study how we can strengthen our current system of wealth taxes. However, many forms of wealth are mobile, and\\nas long as there are di\\x00erences in wealth taxes across jurisdictions, such wealth can and will move. Any tax must therefore be e\\x00ective\\nand cannot be avoided easily, to be a good long-term solution.\\xa0\\nPREVIOUS NEXT\\nIs it true that I have to pay GST on items purchased overseas?

What is Property tax?\\nProperty tax is an asset tax levied on property ownership. It is not a tax on rental income. It is thus levied on the ownership of\\nproperties, irrespective of whether the property is occupied or vacant.\\n2. How is property tax calculated? \\xa0\\nThe property tax is calculated by multiplying the\\xa0 Annual Value (AV) \\xa0of the property with the prevailing\\xa0 property tax rate .\\nAnnual Value (AV)\\nEvery property has an AV. This AV of a property is determined based on market rentals of similar or comparable properties. What this\\nmeans is that if you own a \\x00ve-room \\x00at in Toa Payoh, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) looks at similar \\x00ve-room \\x00ats\\nin Toa Payoh and how much they are rented out at, to determine the Annual Value.\\nProperty Tax rates \\xa0\\nWe have progressive property tax rates for residential properties- the higher the value of the residential property, the higher the tax\\nrate.\\nChanges were introduced in Budget 2022 to both\\xa0 owner-occupied homes , and\\xa0 non-owner occupied residential properties .Property Tax on Residential Property\\nAll you need to know about property tax on residential property\\n6 min read  Published on 24 Nov 2023A Singapore Government Agency W ebsite How to identify\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/data/gov.sg _ Property Tax on Residential Property (5).pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='3/26/24, 4:40 PM gov.sg | Property Tax on Residential Property\\nhttps://www.gov.sg/article/property-tax-on-residential-property 2/5Owner-Occupied Residential Properties \\xa0\\nFor the owner-occupied residential properties, the increased tax rates a\\x00ect only those with Annual Value above $30,000 . That means\\nthat all owner-occupied HDB \\x00ats are not a\\x00ected. The new rates took e\\x00ect on 1 January 2023 and 1 January 2024.\\nNon-Owner-Occupied Residential Properties\\n(This refers to residential buildings which are not owner-occupied and does not include residential land.)\\nAll non-owner-occupied residential properties will face higher property taxes. The tax rates for these are higher because these\\nproperties include second homes and those held for investment.

Why does my Annual Value change over the years?\\nAs property tax is an asset tax based on property ownership, AV is reviewed and adjusted to re\\x00ect the change in market values of\\ncomparable property. The AV may be revised upwards, downwards or kept at the same level depending on the market values.\\n5. Why do I have to pay property tax on my home when I am an owner-occupier and not deriving rental income? \\xa0\\nProperty tax is based on property ownership and therefore is levied regardless of whether the property is owner-occupied, vacant or\\nrented out. However, to encourage home ownership,\\xa0we have a lower tax rate for owner-occupied residential properties.\\nFor more information on the concessionary owner-occupier's tax rate, please refer to IRAS'\\xa0 website .\\n6.

Why not use Capital Value to estimate Annual Value for property tax calculation? \\xa0\\nIn Singapore,\\xa0we use rental transactions of comparable properties to determine the AV of the property for the purpose of property tax,\\nfor two reasons.\\nFirst, there are generally more rental transactions than sales transactions, to allow AV to be determined for each property based on\\ncomparable properties. Second, movements in sale prices are more volatile than rentals. Hence, using rental transactions to derive the\\nAV helps to keep property tax more stable for property owners.\\nThis practice of using market rents to determine the AV is also adopted by other jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Malaysia.\\n8. How else do we tax wealth?\\xa0\\nWe tax wealth through the property tax, stamp duty, and additional registration fee for motor vehicles. The higher value the residential\\nproperty or motor vehicle, the higher the tax.\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe will continue to study how we can strengthen our current system of wealth taxes. However, many forms of wealth are mobile, and\\nas long as there are di\\x00erences in wealth taxes across jurisdictions, such wealth can and will move. Any tax must therefore be e\\x00ective\\nand cannot be avoided easily, to be a good long-term solution.\\xa0\\nPREVIOUS NEXT\\nIs it true that I have to pay GST on items purchased overseas?

What this\\nmeans is that if you own a \\x00ve-room \\x00at in Toa Payoh, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) looks at similar \\x00ve-room \\x00ats\\nin Toa Payoh and how much they are rented out at, to determine the Annual Value.\\nProperty Tax rates'),\n",

              "\"\\n\\nTembusu is a tree that is native to Southeast Asia. It is also known as Ficus microcarpa, and it belongs to the Moraceae family. The tree is named after the Tembusu fruit, which is edible and has a sweet and sour flavor. The Tembusu tree is known for its distinctive, umbrella-shaped canopy and its large, glossy leaves. It is a popular ornamental tree in many parts of Southeast Asia, including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The Tembusu tree is also the national tree of Singapore, and it is often used in the country's coat of arms and national emblem. In addition to its ornamental value, the Tembusu tree is also considered to have medicinal properties, and its bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine for centuries. The Tembusu tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, and it is typically found in forests, parks, and gardens. It is a slow-growing tree, and it can take many years for it to reach maturity.\""

Capital Value refers to the market value of a property, while Annual Value refers to the potential annual rental income that the property can generate.\\n\\nIn Singapore, AV is used for property tax calculation, as it is a more accurate and fairer method for assessing the tax liability of property owners. AV is based on the potential annual rental income of the property, taking into account factors such as the size, location, age, and condition of the property. This method ensures that property owners pay a tax that is proportionate to the income that their property can generate, rather than the market value of the property.\\n\\nUsing Capital Value to estimate Annual Value could lead to inaccurate tax assessments, as properties in the same area with different sizes, ages, and conditions may have the same Capital Value, but their potential rental income may be different. For example, a larger or newer property may have a higher AV than a smaller or older property, even if they have the same CV.\\n\\nTherefore, it is important to use the correct method for calculating property tax, and the AV method is the preferred method in Singapore.'"

This AV of a property is determined based on market rentals of similar or comparable properties.
